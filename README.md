# Students-Performance-in-Exams This dataset contains students' scores in math, reading, and writing, along with demographic info like gender, race, parental education, lunch type, and test prep. The goal is to analyze factors affecting scores and build a linear regression model to predict math scores.
# Student Performance Linear Regression

This project uses a student performance dataset to predict math scores based on other features like parental education level, test preparation course, and lunch type.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about students, including:
- Gender
- Race/Ethnicity
- Parental level of education
- Lunch
- Test preparation course
- Scores in Math, Reading, and Writing

## ðŸ’» What We Did

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Data Visualization (EDA)  
- Outlier Detection  
- Encoding Categorical Features  
- Linear Regression Model  
- Model Evaluation & Visualization

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Used

- **Linear Regression** was applied to predict the `math_score`.


## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open it in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all the cells step by step.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
